## Objective

cPanel is a control panel that facilitates the management of web hosting. It makes complex tasks more accessible, including to new users. It offers a wide range of features, such as: 

- emails
- domains
- databases
- Security
- etc.

This simplifies website hosting, thanks to a graphical interface for automating settings.

**Find out how to deploy cPanel with pre-installed applications on a VPS.**

## Requirements

- You must have a [recent VPS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/){.external} solution  (Value, **Essential**, **Comfort** or **Elite** solutions)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we)

## Instructions

To install your cPanel server, order a VPS with the cPanel distribution.

When your VPS is ready, you will receive an email providing the information to connect to your cPanel server:

```
 |    Your application(s):
 |    Application: cpanel
 |    You can connect to cPanel from https://<hostname>:2087/<session_parameters>
```

If you already have a VPS and want to have cPanel on it, you can reinstall the VPS from your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we) via a [cPanel-compatible OS](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/os/).

> [!warning]
>
> If you reinstall a VPS, all data stored on the VPS will be lost.

### First login

Once you have received the email containing the unique link, click on this link to perform the initial configuration. If the link has already expired, connect to the server via SSH and run the command "sudo whmlogin" to generate a new link.

The URL generated by the “sudo whmlogin” command allows you to log in to your WHM interface without any credentials (user and password). WHM is an overlayer of cPanel. You will be able to access cPanel after completing the following steps.

#### Step 1: Read and accept the cPanel Terms of Use

Read and accept the cPanel Terms of Use.

#### Step 3: Set the root password

Now you should be able to login to WHM and SSH using the root user with the password that was just set.

### Securing your service

We recommend that you take further additional steps to ensure you secure your WHM and VPS. For this we recommend reading the recommendations provided by cPanel [here](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/security/tips-to-make-your-server-more-secure/).

Furthermore we recommend setting up the [OVHcloud network firewall](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/firewall_network) and [set up a backup solution](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/virtual_private_servers/secure_your_vps#backing-up-your-system-and-your-data) on your VPS.

**E.g. to purchase a pack of 100 SMS credits, each credit costs 0.048 €**

Sending 1 SMS message in Ireland costs 0.8 credit. With this pack, you can send 125 SMS messages in Ireland.
Sending 1 SMS message in India costs 0.1 credit. With this pack, you can send 1,000 SMS messages in India.

### **Automatic re-crediting**

To ensure that you are never short of credit on your account, you can enable automatic re-crediting. Once a minimum threshold of remaining credit has been reached, a new number of credits is automatically added to your SMS account.

To enable automatic re-crediting, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, then go to the `Telecom`{.action} tab. Next, click on the `SMS`{.action} section in the services bar on the left-hand side. Choose the SMS account you would like to enable automatic re-crediting for.

Go to the `Options`{.action} menu (1), then `Automatic re-crediting`{.action} (2).

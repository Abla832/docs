## Objective

This guide explains the Order Number or Purchase Order (PO) applied to OVHcloud billing.

## Instructions

### Order Number and Purchase Order (PO) Number

When purchasing goods or services, companies are required to validate purchase orders. Most of the time, this validation is done by returning a document (paper or digital format) to the company's letterhead that recalls the goods or services purchased while specifying an order number.
This document is usually called **Purchase Order** and is abbreviated to **PO**.

For the company issuing the PO, the purpose of this document is to control purchases of goods and services from its suppliers, including by requiring that all invoices issued include a PO Number.

There are essentially two types of commands, described below.

#### Purchase Order (PO)

This is a document confirming the order of goods or services for a fixed quantity and for a fixed duration.

For OVHcloud, the document must contain at least the following information:

* Company name of the contractor
* Order number
* Type(s) of services ordered
* Quantities
* Unit prices
* Effective date
* End date

#### Blanket Purchase Order (BPO)

This is a document confirming the order of goods or services for a variable quantity with a maximum amount and for a fixed duration.

For OVHcloud, the document must contain at least the following information:

* Company name of the contractor
* Order number
* Type(s) of services ordered
* Unit prices
* Total order amount
* Effective date
* End date

### How to enter a Purchase Order Number (PO)

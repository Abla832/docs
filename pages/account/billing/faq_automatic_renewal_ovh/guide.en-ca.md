Here are the answers to your questions about the new automatic renewal process.

## What are the main changes?

### Which products does this concern?
Starting in December 2017, the following products will be part of the new renewal process: dedicated servers, VPS and Hosted Exchange. 

### Will ordering these products be different in some way?
When placing a new order, all you need to do is register a payment method to ensure that the automatic renewal will work properly.

### What will happen with the products I already own?
In your customer interface, you will be invited to switch over to the new renewal system. 

## Payment methods

### Which means of payment are accepted?
The following means of payment are accepted: credit card (Visa or Mastercard) and payment through PayPal.

### Can one means of payment be linked to several customer accounts?
Yes, this is allowed. However, if such tolerance ever leads to abuse, it could be called into question.

### My credit card will expire soon: what should I do?
When the expiry date of your credit card approaches, we will send you an email alert. You are then invited to add a new method of payment. 

### What happens when there is no payment method?
If there is no payment method linked to your account, we cannot guarantee that your contract will be renewed and therefore that your services will continue beyond their expiry date. In the event that full payment is not made, your services will be terminated. 

### I cancelled my credit card. What should I do?
Go to your customer control panel and add a new payment method. You will then be able to delete the cancelled credit card from the payment methods associated with your account.

### I’m acting on behalf of an administration and I don’t have a credit card. What should I do?
Please contact our support, who can guide you throughout this process. OVH has set up a system especially designed to suit the needs of administrators.

## Details on how the process works

### At which dates will my active payment method be debited?
A first invoice will be issued on the day your service is delivered and a prorate will be done in order to align the product with the first of the month.

There are 2 possible scenarios:

- Example 1: you chose a monthly renewal.

Your service expires on March 15, 2018.
On March 15, you will receive an invoice that corresponds to the period from  03/15/2018 au 04/01/2018. After this, billing will continue automatically on a monthly basis on the first of each month.

- Example 2: you chose a yearly renewal.

Your service expires on March 15, 2018.
On March 15, you will receive an invoice corresponding to the period from 03/15/2018 to 04/01/2019. Annual billing will automatically start again on every April 1st.

### When should I request for a service to be cancelled?
You can request the cancellation of a service directly from your customer control panel (Billing > My services), up until the 19th day of the month during which your billing cycle expires. Beyond that date, the cancellation will be registered but will only take effect at the end of the period for which your services will have been tacitly renewed. 

### At which date will the cancellation of my service come into effect?
By default, the cancellation is effective on the last day of the billing cycle. 

### I requested for my service to be cancelled, but I want to withdraw that request. What should I do?
Login to your customer control panel (Billing > My services) and follow the instructions for the withdrawal of your cancellation request.

## Non-payment

### I received an email regarding a non-payment ; what should I do ?
Follow the procedure to clear your account as indicated in the email you received or login to your control panel. You will need to pay by credit card or through PayPal within 7 days after receiving the email. Failing to do so will result in the suspension of your services.  Please contact our support for more details. 

### How much time do I have to resolve a payment incident?
You must pay for any outstanding invoice within 7 days of the date when the payment incident occurred. Please know that if you fail to pay within 7 days, we will suspend your service and we will launch a recovery process against you. Moreover, we reserve the right to suspend all of your services if you haven’t corrected the situation.

## Instructions

### Purchase order

A purchase order is generated when you place an order. It lists the products ordered, their price, and any reductions or promo offers that have been applied.

|Number|Description|
|---|---|
|1|All of the information related to the purchase order is listed here: its number, its creation date and its expiry date. Please note that expired purchase orders will no longer appear in your Control Panel.|
|2|If you are logged in to the Control Panel when you place the order, the billing contact will appear here. For further information on the different contact types, please read [this guide](../../customer/managing-contacts/).|
|3|If you have set a default payment method, it will be offered here. If your product is renewed automatically, a default payment method is required.|
|4|Here, you will find the available payment methods. We can only offer the payment methods authorised in the account’s country of origin, or those linked to the account type.|

You can view your purchase order at any time in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie){.external}, as explained below.

### Accessing purchase orders via the OVHcloud Control Panel

On this page, you will see the following information:

- the date on which the order was placed
- the order number
- the order status
- the purchase order amount, including VAT

The various order statuses are listed below:

|Status|Definition|

|Being processed|Your order is in the process of being delivered — please wait. Depending on the service you have ordered, this step may last a few minutes or a few hours.|
|Complete|You have received your order, and your access details have been sent to you by email (if access details are required).|

You can also view the purchase order in HTML format by clicking on `...`{.action} to the right of your order, then `View order in HTML format`{.action}.

## Objective

Creating a project is the first step in deploying [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/public-cloud/).
 
**This guide will take you through the steps of creating your first OVH Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca)
- a valid [payment method](../../billing/manage-payment-methods/) saved in your OVHcloud account

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and click on `Create your first OVH Public Cloud project`{.action}. Alternatively, for newly created accounts with no services, this option will be available in the `Dashboard`{.action} area as soon as you log into your account.

Give your **Project name**, read and agree to the **General terms of service.**

If this is your first time creating a Public Cloud project, you can add a voucher if applicable. Available vouchers can be retrieved [here](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/public-cloud/).

> [!primary]
> It is necessary to use the voucher provided for your respective branch.
>

> [!alert]
> If you had previously created a project in your account, you will not be able to use a voucher, even if the project was deleted a long time ago.
> 

Once done, click on the `Continue`{.action} button.

Next, you will be prompted to **Register a payment method** if you do not have one already. This will be requested even if a voucher is applied. Having a valid payment method ensures that your service can be renewed via automatic payments. 

You can register a Credit card or a Paypal account. 

If you add a Credit card, you will be charged a **small fee** to confirm your card's validity. This will be returned once the process is completed.

If you add a Paypal account, you will be charged an **upfront fee** of $30. This fee is non refundable.

Fill in the necessary information and confirm by clicking on the `Add`{.action} button.

Once the payment method is confirmed, the project creation will be initiated:

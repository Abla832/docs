## Objective

As a result of increased activity, or simply new needs, your instance may not be able to meet this new burden due to a lack of resources. However, with the Public Cloud, you can increase the resources available to your instance, and this can be done with just a few clicks.

**This guide will show you how to resize your instance in your OVHcloud Control Panel.**

> Only upscaling is possible for classic models.
> In addition, this manipulation causes the instance to be shut down for the time of the operation.
> 

> [!success]
>
> Flex instances allow resizing to higher or lower models due to a locked single disk size.

## Objective

You may need to configure a failover IP address on your instances for different reasons. For example, you may be:

- Hosting several websites on your instance.
- Hosting international projects.

To meet these needs, you can order a failover IP address for your Public Cloud instances.

These failover IP addresses can only be migrated to instances in the same project.

**This guide explains how to buy a failover IP for an OVHcloud Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au){.external}
- a [Public Cloud instance](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/public-cloud/public-cloud-first-steps/) in your OVHcloud Control Panel.

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section, and select the Public Cloud project of your choice.<br>
In the left-hand menu, click on `IP Failover`{.action} in the 'Network' section.

Then click on the `Public Cloud`{.action} button and choose `Buy failover IPs`{.action}.

A new menu will then appear:

Enter the following information:

- The number of failover IPs you want to order (IP blocks are not currently available)
- The instance on which the IPs will be routed
- The location of the IPs

You will also need to accept the General Terms and Conditions of Service.

Each failover IP will cost you â‚¬2 ex. VAT. They will then be renewed automatically and free of charge every month.

They are available in the following locations in Europe:

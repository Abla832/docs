## Objective

By default, the Public Cloud projects as well as the resources total (RAM, CPU, disk space, number of instances, etc.) you can use are limited for security reasons.

To be able to use additional resources and projects, the quotas need to be increased.

**This guide explains how to request and increase a Public Cloud quota in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**


## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca)
- a [valid payment method](../../billing/manage-payment-methods/) registered in your OVHcloud account
- you have exhausted the project quota of your OVHcloud account

## Instructions

### Increasing your resources quota

In compliance with internal criteria (seniority, existence of paid invoices, etc.), you are now free to request quota increases for your Public Cloud projects resources directly from your OVHcloud Control Panel.

You can increase your resources manually or automatically.

#### Increasing your resources quota manually

This procedure allows you to manually request a quota increase and validate with an upfront payment (Public Cloud credit)

The amount of credit to add will depend on the internal criteria mentioned above.

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca) and switch to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Quota and Regions`{.action} in the left-hand sidebar.

This page provides an overview of regions and their available resources. A warning will be displayed next to a resource as soon as 80% of its current quota is reached.

Click on the `Increase your quota!`{.action} button and Select the Public Cloud project of your choice.

Next, click on the drop down arrow next to "Select the volume" to view the list of quotas currently available to upgrade your resources to. This also displays the amount you need to pay to instantly benefit from these resources.

In our example, we currently have « 50 Vms » and we wish to raise our resources quota to « 100 Vms »

In this case, **$1581 CAD** automatically charged to the payment method once we click on the `Confirm`{.action} button.

#### Increasing your resources quota automatically through « Auto-scaling quota »

This option allows you to request an automatic and gradual increase of your resources quota. This is not an instant process and the time frame will depend on one or more of the internal criteria mentioned above. 

With this procedure, no upfront payment is required. However, it is not recommended in the case of an urgent need.

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca) and switch to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Quota and Regions`{.action} in the left-hand sidebar.

Click on the `?`{.action} button for more information about this feature, then click on `Auto-scaling quota`{.action} to enable it.

Once done, auto-scaling will now be enable for your project and your resources quota will be increased periodically.

### Increasing the quota of your Public Cloud projects

Project quotas cannot be raised from the OVHcloud Control Panel. To proceed with this request, you have to open a support ticket from your OVHcloud account.

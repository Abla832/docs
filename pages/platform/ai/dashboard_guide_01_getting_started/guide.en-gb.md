## Objective

OVHcloud provides a set of managed AI tools designed for building your machine learning projects.

This guide explains how to get started with OVHcloud AI Dashboard, a consolidated view of your usages of the OVHcloud AI tools.

## Requirements

- a [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Introduction

**AI Dashboard** is not a product but an overview of all AI products you use, billing information, security information and guide (like this one) that you can read.
It's accessible via the main menu `AI & Machine Learning` in the `Public Cloud` universe.

You can see more details on the prices of the AI tools in the [documentation](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/prices/#ai-&-machine-learning).

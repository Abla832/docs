## Objective

Public Cloud Databases allow you to focus on building and deploying cloud applications while OVHcloud takes care of the database infrastructure and maintenance in operational conditions.

**This guide explains how to connect to a MySQL database instance with a Command Line Interface (CLI).**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.de/&ovhSubsidiary=de);
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account;
- An up and running Public Cloud Database for MySQL.

## Concept

To interact correctly with the MySQL instance, we need to first install something called a MySQL client, in order to connect and control the MySQL service remotely.
It's a Client-Server interaction.

## Instructions

### Installing the MySQL client

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that a MySQL client is natively integrated in the MySQL software package but it does not allow the use of Service URI.
>

You first need to install a software to interact with your MySQL instance remotely. This official software can be installed on various client machines such as your own computer, a VPS or a virtual machine. The only rule is to be able to reach the public network (Internet) and have sufficient rights to install it.

In order to do so and depending on your configuration, you may need to follow official MySQL documentation to install MySQL Shell (*mysqlsh*), more powerful compared to MySQL Client (*mysql*).

MySQL Shell is not mandatory but much more convenient to use compared to standard MySQL Clients, since you can connect with Service URI instead of individual parameters.

Follow the steps here after selecting Windows, MacOS or Linux as operating system: <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-install.html>

Once installed, you need to catch your IP address in order to authorise connections from this specific client.

If you don't know how to get your IP, please visit a website like [www.WhatismyIP.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/){.external}.
Copy the IP address numbers shown on this website and keep them for later.
In our example, we will use the (fake) IP 109.190.200.59.

We are now ready to learn how to connect to our MySQL instance.

### Configure your MySQL instance to accept incoming connections

Before making a connection, we need to verify that our MySQL instance is correctly configured.

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.de/&ovhSubsidiary=de) and switch to `Public Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. After selecting your Public Cloud project, click on `Databases`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar, and select your MySQL instance.

#### Step 1: Verify your user grants and password

Select the `Users`{.action} tab. By default a first user called **avnadmin** is created, with permissions to perform most of the usual DB management tasks. 

If you don't remember the user's password, you can either create a new user or regenerate the password of an existing user. Be careful! By doing so you will need to update each access configuration in which you already use this user/password pair.

This first user **avnadmin** comes with the following grants:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO "avnadmin"@"%" WITH GRANT OPTION

GRANT REPLICATION_APPLIER,ROLE_ADMIN ON *.* TO "avnadmin"@"%" WITH GRANT OPTION
```

We rely on official MySQL grants and privileges. You can manage them yourself via CLI or code.
So far, **user grants and privileges management is not supported via OVHcloud Control Panel neither OVHcloud API**.

Please read the [official MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html){.external} to select the right grants and privileges for your use-case.


In our example, we will simply reset the **avnadmin** password.

Once created or updated, the user has to be ready and have the status "Enabled" in the Control Panel.

#### Step 2: Authorise incoming connections from the MySQL client

In this step, select the `Authorised IP's`{.action} tab (Access Control List).
By default, a Public Cloud Database does not accept any form of connection from the outside world.
This can help to prevent intrusive connection attempts.

Click to authorise a new IP, and enter the previously found IP of your remote client. In our case we will enter 109.190.200.59.

![Add an IP](images/ip_authorize.png){.thumbnail}

> [!primary]
>
> If you want to allow any connection from the outside, you can enter the IP 0.0.0.0/0. Please use it carefully.
>

### Get your connection information (Service URI)

Now all the setup should be done, from the remote client and the MySQL instance.

Select the `General Information`{.action} tab. In the **Login information** section, copy the Service URI.

It should be similar to this:

```
mysql://<username>:<password@<hostname>t<port>/defaultdb?ssl-mode=REQUIRED
```

A bit of information to know:

- It will pass the username and password arguments;
- Will connect to the hostname;
- to the "defaultdb" database directly;
- on the specified MySQL port (dynamic allocation);
- All of that securely, with TLS activated (SSL mode).

We will now follow official MySQL documentation to perform our first connection.

In your CLI, type **mysqlsh --version**. The result should look like this:

```console
laptop$mysqlsh --version
/snap/mysql-shell/29/bin/mysqlsh   Ver 8.0.23 for Linux on x86_64 - for MySQL 8.0.23 (Source distribution)
```

It means that mysqlsh is correctly installed and working properly. If you do not see something like this result, please go back to the previous step and reinstall MySQL shell.


### Connect to your MySQL instance

We will follow official MySQL documentation: <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html>.

To perform a connection, simply type **mysqlsh --sql** followed by the Service URI copied before:

```console
laptop$mysqlsh --sql "mysql://<username>:<password@<hostname>t<port>/defaultdb?ssl-mode=REQUIRED"
```

Don't forget you need to modify the username, password, hostname and port.
In our example, it will look like this:

```console
laptop$mysqlsh --sql "mysql://avnadmin:Mysup3rs3cur3p4ssw0rd@mysql-ab123456-cd7891011.database.cloud.ovh.net:20184/defaultdb?ssl-mode=REQUIRED"
```

Once connected correctly, you should see something similar to:

```console
MySQL Shell 8.0.23

Type '\help' or '\?' for help; '\quit' to exit.
WARNING: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```

Congratulations! You are now fully able to interact with your MySQL instance!

### MySQL client usage

Once connected, you can manage your MySQL instance with built-in MySQL client methods.

Please follow the official MySQL documentation.

To verify:
- `SHOW DATABASES;` will list all the databases;
- `select * from mysql.user;` will display information about existing users.


In our example, it will look like this:

```sql
mysql-sql [defaultdb]> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| defaultdb          |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.0046 sec)
```

```sql
defaultdb=> \h CREATE DATABASE
Command:     CREATE DATABASE
Description: create a new database
Syntax:
CREATE DATABASE name
    [ [ WITH ] [ OWNER [=] user_name ]
           [ TEMPLATE [=] template ]
           [ ENCODING [=] encoding ]
           [ LOCALE [=] locale ]
           [ LC_COLLATE [=] lc_collate ]
           [ LC_CTYPE [=] lc_ctype ]
           [ TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name ]
           [ ALLOW_CONNECTIONS [=] allowconn ]
           [ CONNECTION LIMIT [=] connlimit ]
           [ IS_TEMPLATE [=] istemplate ] ]

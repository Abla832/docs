## Objective

As part of the MX Plan solution upgrade, a migration is planned from the current solution using Outlook Web Access (OWA) webmail to the Zimbra solution and its webmail.

If you are affected by this migration, you will find the most frequently asked questions here.

### Zimbra, what is it?

Zimbra is a popular open-source collaborative solution. You will be migrated to a professional version (Zimbra Network Edition) of this solution.

Zimbra offers many features that will soon be available in OVHcloud catalogs.

### What are the differences between Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Zimbra webmail?

Zimbra offers the same features and ergonomics close to OWA. A guide to getting started with Zimbra will be available soon.

### Does migration open up new features?

Migrating to the new webmail maintains the same level of services as the previous one.

### When will my services be migrated?

Notification emails for each service will be sent to you **1 week** and then **1 day** before the migration.

Your services will be migrated gradually, so it is possible that your different services will be migrated several weeks apart.

### How do I prepare for my migration to Zimbra?

The migration does not require any action on your part regarding the content of email accounts.

However, a short service interruption is required during the migration phase. It is therefore strongly recommended that you inform your users when the migration date for your email accounts will be communicated to you.

### Do I need to make any changes when migrating to Zimbra?

This migration was designed to minimize the impact on our customers. No changes are expected from you.

However, good practices in terms of managing passwords require manipulation.<br>
Before the migration, you will be informed if you need to change your password. If this is the case, you will receive a list of temporary passwords securely for the email accounts to manage after the migration.<br>
These one-time passwords will allow your users to log in to the Zimbra web interface. Once you have logged in to Zimbra, each user will be forced to reset their password.

### Are there any changes to be expected in the OVHcloud Control Panel?

There are no changes planned in the Control Panel. Since the migration is under a new solution, some minor features may not be accessible in the first few weeks after the migration.

### Will I need to reconfigure my email software?

No, the migration does not require a reconfiguration on your email software.

If you change your password, you will need to enter the new password in your email client.

### Does the migration change the billing for my service?

No, the migration to the new Zimbra webmail solution is included in your solution. There are no changes to the billing section or contract of your MX Plan service.

### Where can I find guides?

A user guide for Zimbra will be available soon, before the migration, in our documentation catalog.

### Where will my emails be hosted after the migration?

The migration is done within our French datacentres. Your data will remain in France.

### Will there be any changes regarding the processing of my data?

No changes are planned regarding the processing of data and its use. You can find all this information on the contract for your MX Plan solution.

### How do I stay on current webmail (OWA)?

You can migrate to an OWA webmail solution at any time, should you choose to do so, namely Email Pro or Exchange. To do this, please refer to our guide on " [Migrating an MX Plan email address to an Email Pro or Exchange account](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/migrating/migration_control_panel) ".

### Can I oppose the migration?

No. OVHcloud is committed to providing a service with the best value for money for its MX Plan offerings. This is why we have chosen to migrate the current offers to the Zimbra solution.

However, you can still take advantage of the OWA interface [by migrating your email accounts to an Email Pro or Exchange solution](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/migrating/migration_control_panel)

### Can I cancel my MX Plan solution?

To cancel your solution in the " My services " section of the OVHcloud Control Panel, please refer to the MX Plan section of our guide on " [Canceling your OVHcloud services ](/pages/account_and_service_management/managing_billing_payments_and_services/how_to_cancel_services#mxplan) ".

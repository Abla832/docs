## Introduction

On August 8th 2023, Intel has issued a security bulletin disclosing a vulnerability in its recent computer processor microarchitecture. Named "Gather Data Sampling (GDS)" by Intel, the vulnerability is also known as "Downfall".<br>
Labelled CVE-2022-40982 and rated by Intel as Medium, the issue allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information processed by the CPU in specific circumstances.<br>
The issue affects all software running on the affected processors, including virtual machines, sandboxes, containers, and processes. Exploitation software has been released by the researchers.

At least the following microarchitectures are vulnerable:

- Skylake
- Kaby Lake
- Ice Lake
- Comet Lake
- Rocket Lake
- Tiger Lake

## Impacts on OVHcloud products

In response to that event, we immediately reviewed the security bulletin and technical information and determined the following potential impact on our products.

| Range of products     | Products                                     | Impact               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Public Cloud          |                                              |                      |
| Hosted Private Cloud  |                                              |                      |
| Web Hosting & Domains | All products                                 | Not impacted         |
| Bare Metal Cloud      |                                              | Potentially impacted |
|                       | Other commercial ranges of dedicated servers | Not impacted         |

## How to mitigate the vulnerability

### Customer-initiated mitigation

#### Loading a patched microcode at boot with a firmware package update

This solution will trigger the update of the processor microcode through an operating system update (the linux-firmware package for instance).
You might do it as soon your OS editor or community distribute the updated package. This method is dependent on your distribution or Operating System editor and will only work if the appropriate microcode has been provided by Intel.

### OVHcloud-initiated mitigation

#### Using OVHcloud iPXE

## As an administrator of a potentially vulnerable server, what should I do?

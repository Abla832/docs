## Migration options and alternative services

OVHcloud recommends using your dedicated serverâ€™s OS firewall: Linux iptable or Microsoft Windows Firewall.

OVHcloud will soon make a guide available, accessible from [this page](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/dedicated/securing-a-dedicated-server/#configure-the-internal-firewall-iptables), to help configure the Linux iptable firewall and the Microsoft Windows firewall.

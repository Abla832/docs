## Objective

OVHcloud has combined all Kimsufi and So you Start dedicated servers in a product line called Eco, to give you a better overview of our configurations. Due to these changes, you can now manage all of your services, across all ranges, from the OVHcloud Control Panel. To support you in this change if your have opted for a purchase on the Eco range, we have set up a guide explaining the OVHcloud Control Panel and its options.

**This guide is designed to help you familiarise yourself with the OVHcloud Control Panel**

> [!warning]
> Please note that despite the interface change, the options available for your server range will remain the same. Some options will only be available for servers in the OVHcloud range.

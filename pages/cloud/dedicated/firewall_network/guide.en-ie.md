**Last updated 23rd December 2021**

## Objective

To protect its global infrastructure and its customersâ€™ servers, OVHcloud offers a firewall that can be configured and integrated into the **Anti-DDoS** (VAC) solution: the Firewall Network. This is an option that will enable you to limit how much your service is exposed to attacks from the public network.

**This guide will show you how to configure your Network Firewall.**

## Requirements

- You must have an OVHcloud service with a Firewall Network ([Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.ie/dedicated_servers/){.external}, [VPS](https://www.ovh.ie/vps/){.external}, [Public Cloud instance](https://www.ovh.ie/public-cloud/instances/){.external}, [Private Cloud](https://www.ovh.ie/private-cloud/){.external},  [Failover IP](https://www.ovh.ie/dedicated_servers/ip_failover.xml){.external}, etc.)
- You must have access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie){.external}.
- You must have basic network skills


## Instructions

### Enable the Firewall Network

> [!primary]
>
> The Firewall Network protects the IPs that are associated with a machine. You must therefore configure each IP separately; it is not possible to configure the server as a whole.
> 

In the OVHcloud Control Panel, click on the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} menu, then click on the `IP`{.action} section at the bottom of the column on the left of the page. Next, click on the `...`{.action} to the right of the relevant IPv4 and select `Create Firewall`{.action}.

- You will then be asked to confirm:

- You can then `Enable the firewall`{.action} and `Configure the Firewall`{.action} by clicking once more on the gear icon next to the IPv4:

![Applying the rules in the configuration](images/activationconfig.png){.thumbnail}

You can set up to **20 rules per IP**.


> [!warning]
>
> The firewall is enabled automatically upon each DDoS attack, and cannot be disabled before the attack ends. This is why it is important to keep the firewall rules up to date.
> As a default setting you do not have any configured rules, so all connections can be set up.
> If you do have any, remember to check your firewall rules regularly, even if you disable it.
> 


> [!primary]
>
> - The UDP fragmentation is blocked (DROP) as a default setting. When you enable the Firewall Network, if you use a VPN, remember to correctly configure your maximum transmission unit (MTU). For example, on OpenVPN, you can tick `MTU test`{.action}.
> - The Firewall Network is not taken into account within the OVHcloud network, so the rules set up do not affect the connections in this internal network.
>


### Configuring the Firewall Network

To add a rule, click on `Add a rule`{.action}:


![Add a rule](images/ajoutregle1.png){.thumbnail}

For each rule you must choose:

- a priority (from 0 to 19, 0 being the first rule to be applied, followed by the others);
- an action (`Authorise`{.action} or `Refuse`{.action});
- the protocol;
- an IP (optional);
- the source port (TCP only)
- the destination port (TCP only)
- the TCP options (TCP only)


![Details on adding a rule](images/ajoutregle4.png){.thumbnail}


> [!primary]
>
> - Priority 0: we advise that you authorise the TCP protocol on all the IPs with an `established`{.action} option. The `established`{.action} option enables you to verify that the packet is part of a session that has previously been opened (already started). If you do not authorise it, the server will not receive the TCP protocol feedback from the SYN/ACK requests.
> - Priority 19: refuses all of the IPv4 protocol if any rules before 19th (the last possible) are not filled in.
> 


### Configuration example

To make sure that only the SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and UDP (on port 10000) ports are left open when authorising the ICMP, you need to follow the rules below:

![Configuration example](images/exemple.png){.thumbnail}

The rules are sorted chronologically from 0 (the first rule read) to 19 (the last). The chain stops being scanned as soon as a rule is applied to the packet.

For example, a packet for TCP port 80 will be captured by rule 2 and the rules that come after will not be tested. A packet for TCP port 25 will only be captured at the last rule (19) which will block it, because OVHcloud does not authorise communication on port 25 in the previous rules.

> [!warning]
>
> If anti-DDoS mitigation is enabled, your Firewall Network rules will be applied, even if you have disabled them. If you wish to disable it, remember to delete your rules.

### Configuring Armor

> [!primary]
> By default, Armor is pre-configured with certain rules that OVHcloud has determined work with the most common games. However, for customers with a Game Dedicated Server, we allow you to go a step further and configure rules for ports as well.
>

In order to configure rules for your ports in Armor, you will first need to log into the OVHcloud Control Panel.<br>
In the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} menu, click on the `IP`{.action} section on the left-hand sidebar. Click on the `...`{.action} next to the IP address of your Game Server and click on `Configure the GAME firewall`{.action}.

![Game_wall](images/GAMEwall2021.png){.thumbnail}

On the following screen, click the `Add a rule`{.action}. button to add a rule to Armor.

![Configure_Armor](images/ConfigureArmor2021.png){.thumbnail}

Enable the ports as needed on the following screen and click on the `Confirm`{.action} button when you are finished adding your rules. You have now successfully configured Armor.

### Conclusion

Having read this tutorial, you should now be able to configure the Network Firewall as well as Armor (for Game dedicated servers) to enhance the security of your OVHcloud services.

## Objective

Within your OVHcloud environment, you can add a new dedicated host in just a few minutes.

**This guide offers a step by step study case to achieve the objective**

## Requirements

- Be an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- Have a user account with access to vSphere (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB))

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> Adding resources through vSphere adds them as hourly resources for billing purposes. If you wish to switch them to monthly resources, it can be changed in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB).
> For more info on this, check out our [Introduction to the Hosted Private Cloud Control Panel](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/private-cloud/control-panel-ovh-private-cloud/)
> 

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Hosts and Clusters`{.action} dashboard and open the tree-view on the left-hand side. You can then access the plugin menus via the `Configure`{.action} tab for the datacentre or the cluster.

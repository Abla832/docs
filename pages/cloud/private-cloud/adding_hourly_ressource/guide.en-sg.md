## Objective

With our [Hosted Private Cloud solutions](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/){.external}, you can add resources that are billed per hour of usage.

**This guide will show you how to add hourly resources via the Hosted Private Cloud vSphere interface.**

## Requirements

- a [Hosted Private Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/){.external} solution

- access to the vSphere client

## Instructions

**Find out how to use the OVH Cloud plugin.**


## Requirements

- an [OVH Private Cloud](https://www.ovh.co.uk/private-cloud/){.external} solution
- access to the vSphere interface


## Instructions

Two dedicated resources can be billed hourly as an option:
- host servers
- datastores

In the vSphere web client, simply go to the “Host and Cluster” section, and open the tree-view on the left-hand side. You can then access the plugin menus via the `Configure`{.action} tab for the datacentre or the cluster.

The `Add Host`{.action} menu is dedicated to host servers. You can view their technical details and order new host servers here.

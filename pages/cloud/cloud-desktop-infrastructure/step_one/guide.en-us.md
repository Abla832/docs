## Objective

In five detailed steps, we will explain how to manage your [Cloud Desktop Infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/solutions/digital-workspace-collaboration/virtual-desktop-infrastructure/){.external}.

**This first guide will explain how to get started with your VMware Horizon 7.1 platform**.

To find out more about developing your own Cloud Desktop Infrastructure, just watch this special [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFnpnANQHzQ&t){.external}.


## Requirements

- You need to have received an email containing your [Cloud Desktop Infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/solutions/digital-workspace-collaboration/virtual-desktop-infrastructure/){.external} credentials.

## Instructions

### General information

The VMware Horizon 7.1 platform has several parts:

- a VMware Horizon 7.1 administrator interface
- a URL for your first pool of virtual desktops
- a [Private Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/){.external} platform for deploying virtual machines and virtual desktops


### Infrastructure

![VMware Horizon 7.1 infrastructure](images/1200.png){.thumbnail}

The admin infrastructure (*View ConnectionServer*, *View composerServer*, *ActiveDirectory*) is deployed, managed and supervised by OVH, so that it doesnâ€™t affect the resource capacities provided to you for deploying desktop pools.

OVH deploys virtual routers (OVH vRouter) and *AccessPoints*, so that your pools have full access to the Private Cloud resources delivered with your platform.

By default, a private network with an *AccessPoint* is configured when the platform is delivered. You can then add other *AccessPoints* via your Control Panel.


### Delivery

You will receive the email below within an hour of completing your purchase order. This will contain all the details you need to log in to your infrastructure, then create and manage your first pool.

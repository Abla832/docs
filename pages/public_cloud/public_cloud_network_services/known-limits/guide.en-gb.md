## IPs used by services

When a service is spawned in a subnet, it is using some IPs from the subnet CIDR. The following table provides the number of IPs used by each services. If the subnet has a 'small' number of available IPs this can have impact ! Since if you use all the L3 services, the total number of IPs used is 7, we advise to use at least `/28` mask.

|Â Used IPs by the service:| in DHCP allocation pool |	outside of allocation pool (gateway_ip) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DHCP |	2 | |	
| Public Cloud Gateway | 1	| 1 |
| Public Cloud Load Balancer (Octavia)	| 3 | |

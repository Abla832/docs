## IPs used by services

When a service is spawned in a subnet, it is using some IPs from the subnet CIDR. The following table provides the number of IPs used by each service. If the subnet has a "small" number of available IPs, this can have impact. If all L3 services are in use, the total number of IPs used will be 7. We advise to use at least a `/28` mask.

|Â Used IPs by the service:| In DHCP allocation pool |	Outside of allocation pool (gateway_ip) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DHCP |	2 | |	
| Public Cloud Gateway | 1	| 1 |
| Public Cloud Load Balancer (Octavia)	| 3 | |

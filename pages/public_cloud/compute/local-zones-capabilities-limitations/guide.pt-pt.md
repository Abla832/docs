## Objective

Local Zones are an extension of Regions that bring OVHcloud services closer to specific locations, offering reduced latency and improved performances for applications.
Local Zones are strategically placed in proximity to areas with high user demand. Their primary goal is to minimize the time it takes for data to travel between the user and the cloud, making services quicker and more responsive.

## Objective

**This guide provides comprehensive information on transitioning from MongoDB's current offerings (Essential, Business, Enterprise) to the newly introduced plans (Discovery, Business, Advanced). It also covers the automated migration process, enabling customers to understand the changes, assess the impacts, and plan for a smooth migration.**

## Requirements

- Active MongoDB Essential, Business, or Enterprise service with OVHcloud.
- Familiarity with your current MongoDB service plan and requirements.
- Understanding of the features and limitations of the new MongoDB plans.

## Instructions

### End of Sale Notification

The introduction of the new MongoDB Discovery, Production, and Advanced plans on 7th December 2023 marks the end of sale for the existing Essential, Business, and Enterprise offerings. This aligns with our product lifecycle policy and aims to provide enhanced services and free usage opportunities to our customers.

### Automated Migration Process

#### Step 1: Understanding the Migration Schedule

The Essential, Business, and Enterprise offerings will be officially discontinued on 31st May 2024. Services using these plans will be automatically migrated to the new offerings based on their current plans:
- Essential and Business services to the Production plan.
- Enterprise services to the Advanced plan.

Migration is planned as a regular maintenance operation, which can also be initiated manually by customers before the scheduled date.

#### Step 2: Preparing for Migration

- **For Essential and Business Services:** Be aware that migration to the Production plan will involve a transition from a single node cluster to a three-member replica set, along with changes in the service flavor and potentially an increase in service pricing based on the new plan's storage and features.
  
- **For Enterprise Services:** Understand that moving to the Advanced plan will not only adjust your service's architecture and flavor but may also lower your overall costs due to significant price reductions across the board, despite potential changes in storage needs.

#### How to Anticipate Migration

Customers are encouraged to migrate their services to the new plans proactively by following the detailed migration guides available on our support site. This preparation ensures a seamless transition and allows for customization of the new plan settings according to specific needs.

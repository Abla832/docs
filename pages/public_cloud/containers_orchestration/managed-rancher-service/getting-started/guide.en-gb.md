## Objective

Container orchestration has become a cornerstone of modern application deployment, offering scalability, flexibility, and resource efficiency. Rancher is an open-source container management platform that simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters.
Managed Rancher Service by OVHcloud, provides a powerful platform for orchestrating Kubernetes clusters seamlessly. In this detailed guide, we will explore the intricacies of setting up and managing containerized workloads.


### Rancher Creation and Access
> [!warning]
>
> During the Alpha phase, Rancher access are directly provided by OVHcloud team. Manager implementation will be available at Beta release phase. Please ignore this part for now.
>

To initiate your journey, log in to the OVHcloud Manager and access the _Managed Rancher Service_ under the _Container & Orchestration_ section.
Using the OVHcloud Manager you can trigger the creation of a Rancher which will be operated and managed by OVHcloud.

Simply click on the 'create' button at the top right of the manager and follow the steps below:

1. Define your Rancher's name
2. Select your Plan between "OVHcloud Edition" (coming soon) and "Standard"
3. Select the Rancher version
4. Click on Create
5. Wait for your Rancher to be created
6. Access the details of your newly created Rancher by click on its name
7. On the "Security and Access" section, click on "Generate access details", confirm, then click on "access Rancher UI"
8. Copy/Paste the provided credentials on the Rancher login page. Note: you will to change your password at first login. If you lose your password you have the possibility to generate a new one by using the "Generate access details" action button.

You now have access to the Rancher dashboard, it is designed to offer an intuitive and comprehensive view of your containerized environment.
This web-based interface serves as your command center for orchestrating containers & clusters, visualizing cluster health, and managing various aspects of your Kubernetes infrastructure. Explore the navigation menu, which includes sections for clusters, projects, applications, and Rancher settings.

As it is a brand new Rancher instance you do not have any downstream Kubernetes clusters, next step is to add some of them. To do so you have two options: Import existing Kubernetes clusters or Create new clusters using Rancher.

### Create or Import your Kubernetes clusters :
####  - Create a Kubernetes cluster with Rancher

Using this option you will be able to create Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Rancher simplifies the creation of clusters by allowing you to create them through the Rancher UI rather than more complex alternatives.
You can use Rancher to launch a Kubernetes cluster using any nodes you want. Rancher can launch Kubernetes on any computers, including:
  - Hosted Kubernetes provider (ex: OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service, AWS EKS, GCP GKE,... )
  - Infrastructure Provider - Public Cloud or Private Cloud (vSphere, Nutanix,...)
  -  Bare-metal servers, cloud hosted or on premise
  -  Virtual machines, cloud hosted or on premise


For the last three options, when Rancher deploys Kubernetes onto these nodes, you can choose between Rancher Kubernetes Engine RKE2 or k3s distributions.
Follow the official Rancher documentation on [How to launch Kubernetes with Rancher](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/launch-kubernetes-with-rancher) explaining how to define cluster settings, number of nodes (master, worker, etcd), authentication, and any additional configurations.

We will detail bellow how to use OVHcloud as a Hosted Kubernetes provider and Infrastructure Provider using our official OVHcloud Drivers.


#####Â 1/ Use OVHcloud as a **Hosted Kubernetes Provider**

#### - Import an existing Kubernetes cluster

For organizations with pre-existing Kubernetes clusters, Rancher simplifies integration. Import your clusters seamlessly, wherever they are deployed, allowing Rancher to take over the management responsibilities. This process facilitates the transition to Rancher without disrupting your existing infrastructure.

You can refer to the official Rancher documentation on how to [Register Existing Cluster](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/register-existing-clusters).

#### - Import an existing OVHcloud [Managed Kubernetes Service](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/kubernetes/) cluster

If you already use our [OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes Service](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/kubernetes/) , you can easily import existing cluster.
The workflow is similar to the one described on the official Rancher documentation on [how to register a cluster](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/register-existing-clusters#registering-a-cluster) and it takes only few minutes.

1. From the Rancher Homepage, click on 'Import Existing'
![Rancher Homepage](images/rancher-homepage.png)
2. Select 'Generic'
![Import Cluster](images/import-cluster.png)
3. Set the Cluster Name (it is not mandatory to match the name of your existing MKS cluster) then click on 'Create'
![Import Cluster Form](images/import-cluster-form.png)
4. Follow the instructions provided on the 'Registration' tab
  ![Register Cluster Instructions](images/register-cluster-instructions.png)

  Run the provided kubectl command on an existing Managed Kubernetes Service cluster that is running a supported Kubernetes version to import it into Rancher:
  ``` shell
  $ kubectl apply -f https://rancher.ovh.net/v3/import/file.yaml
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/proxy-clusterrole-kubeapiserver unchanged
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/proxy-role-binding-kubernetes-master unchanged
  namespace/cattle-system created
  serviceaccount/cattle created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cattle-admin-binding created
  secret/cattle-credentials-ac3c0a4 created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cattle-admin created
  deployment.apps/cattle-cluster-agent created
  service/cattle-cluster-agent created
  ```
5. wait until your cluster becomes available:
![Cluster Dashboard](images/cluster-dashboard-explore.png)
6. Tada ! Your cluster is now federated on your Rancher. You can click on 'Explore' to manage your MKS Cluster.

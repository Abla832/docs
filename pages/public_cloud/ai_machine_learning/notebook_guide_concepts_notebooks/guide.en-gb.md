## Definition

An **AI Notebook** is the workload unit submitted to the cluster. **AI notebooks** are managed Jupyter or VSCode notebooks, with pre-packaged Machine Learning frameworks linked to computing resources (CPU or GPU) and storage space. They are running within OVHcloud infrastructure.

Each AI Notebook is linked to a **Public Cloud** project and specifies the following:
- a type and quantity of computing resources
- a code editor
- a pre-configured Machine Learning framework

## Considerations

> [!warning]
>
> An **AI Notebook** runs continuously until manually interrupted by the user, unless it exceeds **7 days of running**. It will then be automatically stopped. You can choose to automatically restart it using the `auto-restart` option (set this parameter to `True`). The notebook will then restart as is.
>

- [Data](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data) can be attached to a notebook to serve either/both as input for your notebook (e.g. code) or output (e.g.Â model weights).
- If you do not customize your resource request, the default requested is 1 GPU. Memory is not customizable.
- [Billing](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/notebook_guide_billing_concept) for **notebooks** is minute-based and starts from the beginning to the end of the notebook's `RUNNING` status. Each commenced minute is billed completely.
- You can read further on notebook limitations [here](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/notebook_guide_capabilities).

## Under the hood

**AI Notebooks** are Docker containers created, deployed and maintained by OVHcloud's AI teams.
They include a managed code editor and the Machine Learning framework pre-packaged for users according to their needs (computing resources, library versions, ...).

## Notebook lifecycle

During its lifetime the notebook will transit between the following states:

> [!primary]
>
> Only the `RUNNING` time of the notebook **is billed**. For more information about notebooks billing, refer to this [documentation](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/notebook_guide_billing_concept).
>

- `STARTING` the notebook is being started and, if any, the remote data is synchronized. To learn more about data synchronization
- `RUNNING` the notebook is running, you can connect to it and use it
- `STOPPING` the notebook is stopping, your compute resources are freed, your status is saved and, if any, the data is synchronized back
- `STOPPED` the notebook ended normally and you can restart it whenever you want or delete it
- `FAILED` the notebook ended in error, e.g. the process in the notebook finished with a non 0 exit code
- `ERROR` the notebook ended due to a backend error, you may reach our support
- `DELETING` the notebook is being removed
- `DELETE` the notebook and its [workspace](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/notebook_guide_workspace) are is fully deleted

## Objective

By creating an alias for your email address, you can give a “mask” address to your contacts, without having to give your personal email address to the sender. An email address can have multiple aliases.

For example, your email address is **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** and your alias is **anonymous@mydomain.ovh**. You can then send your contacts the address **anonymous@mydomain.ovh** and receive your emails on **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** without the sender having knowledge of **john.smith@mydomain.ovh**.

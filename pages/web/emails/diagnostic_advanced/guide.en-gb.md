## Requirements

- an **MX Plan** or **Email Pro** solution or **Exchange solution**
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

### Are my email offer and/or accounts active?

For your emails to work, you need to have an active email solution. If your email solution is linked to a web hosting plan, check that it has not expired. You can check this information directly in the OVHcloud Control Panel. Your domain name must also be active.

Here is how to ensure that your services are up and running:

- For your domain **name**, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Domain names`{.action} in the left-hand column, then select your domain name. If your domain name has expired, this will be listed at the top of the page.
- For your **Web** Hosting plan, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Hosting plans`{.action} in the left-hand column, then select your Web Hosting plan. The date of expiry or automatic renewal of your hosting will be indicated at the top of the page.
- For an **MXplan** solution, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Emails`{.action} in the left-hand column, then select the domain name concerned. Click the `Email`{.action} accounts tab. Check the status of the email account in the `Status` column.
- For an **Email Pro** solution, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Email Pro`{.action} in the left-hand column, then select your platform. Click the `Email`{.action} accounts tab. Check the status of the email account in the `Status` column.
- For an **Exchange** solution, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Microsoft`{.action} in the left-hand column, then click `Exchange`{.action} and select your platform. Click the `Email accounts`{.action} tab. Check the status of the email account in the `Status` column.

### I can't send emails from my email software

If you use an email client on your computer (Outlook, Mac Mail, Thunderbird, etc.) or smartphone (iOS, Android, etc.), and you experience a sending or receiving technical issue, check the configuration settings according to your email solution and the email client or application you are using.

- For an **MXplan** solution, go to the  [Shared emails - MX Plan](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails/) section in our  **Web Cloud** guides, and check the configuration of your email software in the `Configure on computer` section, or in the `Configure on smartphone` section for your smartphone.

- For an **Email Pro** offer, in the [Email Pro](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails-pro/) section in our  **Web Cloud** guides, check the configuration of your email software in the `Email client configuration` section.

- For an **Exchange** offer, in the [Microsoft Collaborative Solutions ](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/) section in our  **Web Cloud** guides, check the configuration of your email software in the section Exchange `Email clients` or your smartphone in Exchange `Exchange-compatible smartphone and tablet configuration`.

### Are emails functional from webmail?

To ensure that the malfunction is not linked to a configuration error, send and receive a test email directly via OVHcloud webmail. If everything is working properly, check your software configuration using the guides provided.

From your computer browser or smartphone, go to the address <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>.

### I cannot log in to webmail

Make sure you have the right password. If necessary, you can modify it. Also check if two-factor authentication is enabled ([Exchange](https://www.ovh.co.uk/emails/hosted-exchange/) only).

Here is how to change the password for an email address:

- For an **MX Plan** solution, please refer to our guide on [Changing a password for an MX Plan email address](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails/changing-email-address-password/)

- For an **Email Pro** solution, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Email Pro`{.action} in the left-hand column, then select your platform. In the `Email`{.action} accounts tab, click the `...`{.action} button, then click `Modify`{.action} to change the password.

- For an **Exchange** solution, go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Microsoft`{.action} in the left-hand column, then click `Exchange`{.action} and select your platform. In the `Email`{.action} accounts tab, click the `...`{.action} button, then click `Modify`{.action} to change the password. <br> Check if two-factor authentication is enabled in our guide on [Configuring two-factor authentication on an Exchange](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/configuring-2fa-exchange/) account.

### Is there an incident or maintenance in progress for my service?

You can check the various tasks that are currently in progress on <http://travaux.ovh.net/>.

- For **MXplan**, check in the `Emails section`
- For **Email Pro**, go to the `Microsoft section`
- For **Exchange**, go to the `Microsoft section`

### Is the domain name pointing correctly to my email service?

Check that your domain name points correctly to the OVHcloud email servers. To do this, you will need to configure MX records in your DNS zone. <br>Please refer to our guide on [Adding an MX record to a domain](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/domains/web_hosting_configuring_mx_with_the_ovh_dns_zone/) nameâ€™s configuration.

### After sending an email, I receive a message that my email could not be sent, including a 3-digit code

This is an SMTP error return. This indicates that the exchange between the outgoing server and the incoming email server could not be completed correctly. The code is used to determine the type of error the server encountered. It is usually accompanied by a message detailing this error.

An SMTP response consists of a three-digit number. The three digits of the answer each have a particular meaning:

- the first number indicates whether the answer is correct, wrong or incomplete. An SMTP client will be able to determine its next action by examining this first digit;
- The second and third digits provide additional information.

There are four possible values for the first digit of the response code:

|Code|Description|  
|---|---|  
|2 xx|Positive response: the requested action has been completed. A new request can be initiated.|
|3 xx|Temporary positive response: the order has been accepted, but the requested action is pending receipt of more information. The SMTP client should send another command specifying this information.|
|4 xx|Transitional Completion Negative Response: the command was not accepted and the requested action could not occur. However, the error condition is temporary and the action can be requested again.|
|5 xx|Negative reply: the command was not accepted and the requested action could not occur. The SMTP client should not repeat the same request.|

The majority of SMTP negative response codes used by servers are listed below:

|Response codes|Details|Actions|
|---|---|---|
|420|timeout, connection problem|This error message is returned only by the GroupWise mail servers. Contact the destination mail server administrator|
|421|Service not available, transmission channel being closed|Origin of the undetermined error, make sure that sending to another domain works. If yes, please try sending the original email again later|
|432|Email received on the Exchange server stopped|This error message is returned only by Microsoft Exchange mail servers. Contact the destination mail server administrator|
|449|A routing error|This error message is returned only by Microsoft Exchange mail servers. Microsoft recommends that you run a diagnostic with their WinRoute tool|
|450|Requested e-mail action not performed: mailbox unavailable (for example, mailbox busy or temporarily blocked for security or blacklisting reasons)|Check if your IP address of the mail server is not blacklisted ([SpamHaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/){.external}), and also check if your mail does not contain words referring to SPAM.|
|451|Aborted required action: Local processing error|This may be due to a momentary overload, or an incorrect SPF check of the issuing domain. Refer to the additional message provided by the server, or contact the server administrator if this persists|
|452|Requested action not performed: insufficient storage system|Your mail server is `overloaded`. This could also be caused by too many messages trying to be sent at once. Please check your outbox and try again|
|455|Server unable to receive settings|Wait a while, then try again. If this fails, contact the recipient's email server administrator|
|500|Syntax error, unrecognised command (may include errors such as too long command line)|This is often caused by the sender's antivirus or firewall. Check this and try again|
|501|Syntax error in parameters or arguments|This is often caused by an incorrect recipient email address or a sender-side antivirus or firewall problem. Please check the destination address and your antivirus or firewall|
|502|Command not implemented|The settings or options used when sending the email with your SMTP server are recognised but disabled in its configuration. Please contact your service provider|
|503|Server encountered wrong sequence of commands|This is usually due to an authentication problem, make sure you are authenticated on the SMTP server in terms of your email software configuration|
|504|Command parameter not implemented|The settings or options used when sending the email with your SMTP server are recognised but disabled in its configuration. Please contact your service provider|
|550|Requested action not performed: mailbox unavailable|The destination mail server could not verify the email address used. This is most often caused by an invalid destination email address, but can also mean that the destination email server has firewall or connectivity issues. Check the recipient's email address, and/or try again|
|551|Non local user|This is typically used as a spam prevention strategy. It says that the mail relay is not authorised for any reason to relay your message to another server than yours. Please contact your service provider|
|552|Requested e-mail action stopped: storage space exceeded|The user you tried to contact no longer has space to receive messages. Unfortunately, the only solution is to contact the recipient via another method|
|553|Requested action not performed: unauthorised email address|This is usually caused by an incorrect destination email address. Please check that the email address in question is correct|
|554|Transaction failed, `No SMTP service here`)|This is usually a blacklist problem. Check if your email server IP address is blacklisted ([SpamHaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/){.external})|
|555|MAIL FROM / RCPT TO, unrecognised or unimplemented parameters|The outgoing SMTP server does not correctly record the email address used in either your `From` or `A` settings. Please check that the email addresses entered are correct, and also check that you have not exceeded the limit set by OVHcloud: 200 mails/hour/account and 300 mails/hour/ip|

To do this, please refer to our guide on [Activating the email addresses included in your web](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/hosting/activate-email-web-hosting/) hosting plan.

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

Depending on the date your service was activated and if [it was recently migrated](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/mxplan-migration/){.external}, you will be using either the legacy version or the new version of the MX Plan solution. Before you proceed, you will need to check which version you are using. 

To do this, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, and open the `Web Cloud`{.action} section. Click `Emails`{.action}, then choose the name of the MX Plan service concerned. Continue with the next steps, depending on which version you own.

In the pop-up window, enter the following information:

- **First name**: Enter a first name.
- **Name**: Enter a surname.
- **Name to display**: Enter the name you want to be displayed as a sender when you send emails from this address.

Once you have filled in all of the required fields, click `Next`{.action}.

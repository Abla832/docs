**Find out how to delete or reset an email address on your email solution**

## Requirements

- You must have a pre-configured OVHcloud email solution (**MX Plan**, included in our [web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/), included in a [free Start10M hosting package](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/free-web-hosting/), or ordered separately as a standalone solution, such as [**Hosted Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/hosted-exchange/) or [**Email Pro**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/email-pro/)).
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, and `Web Cloud`{.action} section
- access to the email addresses concerned

## In practice <a name="instructions"></a>

OVHcloud offers 3 email solutions, and the concept of account deletion differs depending on which email solution you choose.

- **Email MXplan** : this offer is sold as a pack of several email accounts. When you delete an account, you free up a location on your pack. 
- **Email Pro** and **Hosted Exchange**: these two offers are à la carte, you order an individual subscription by email account. If you want to delete an email address, you will need to **reset** it. Once you have reset your email account, you can use this account again to create a new email address. You can also [cancel the subscription](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/manage-exchange-billing/#deleting-accounts) for this account if you wish to permanently delete it.

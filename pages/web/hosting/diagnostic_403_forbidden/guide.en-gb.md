**Last updated 09th June 2023**

## Objective

A page **“403 forbidden”** may appear when:

- FTP access rights (CHMOD) are insufficient or restricted. Access to the file/folder/website you want to access via your web browser is then denied by the web server of your web hosting plan.

- the **.htaccess** file contains an access restriction rule

- a security plugin protects access to your files/folder/websites via your Internet browser;

- an application firewall is enabled.

Following the detection of suspicious operation, our security robots may temporarily block access to files on your web hosting plan. This device prevents:

- the progress of any potential hacking of your data stored on your web hosting plan

- sending malicious code to other entities/websites, which could then lead to their being hacked

- carrying out illegal operations.
 
 This device also legally protects you from actions resulting from a possible hack of your web hosting towards other organisations/websites. 
 
 *If you are affected by this type of blocking, you will be sent a notification via the email address of the “administrator” contact for your Web Hosting plan*

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/)
- having the [login details](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_connection) to access your hosting plan’s FTP storage space
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyse the situation

If the page **“403 forbidden”** appeared following a modification of your website, [restore all or part of the FTP storage space of your hosting](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_save_and_backup) to an earlier date.

If the available backups do not allow you to restore access to your website, contact a [specialised provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/).

If the page **“403 forbidden”** did not appear following a modification of your website, check your inbox. If you have received an email from our services notifying you that your web hosting plan has been closed for security reasons, please skip directly to [step 2](#step-2) of this guide.

If the page **“403 forbidden”** appeared without any action on your part and you have not received any email from our services about it, check the FTP access rights (CHMOD) of your files/folders as well as the code contained in your **.htaccess* file(s). Also check if this is not generated by a security plugin or application firewall. If necessary, contact a [specialist provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/).

### Step 2: secure your solutions <a name="step-2"></a>

First, check the security of your computer station(s)/device(s):

- Perform security updates for your devices.

- Check that an antivirus is installed, update it and run a full scan. If you do not have one, consult a [specialised provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/) before installing.

- Change all of your local passwords, including your email addresses, following the **best practices** specified in [this guide](/pages/account/customer/manage-ovh-password).

- Change the passwords for all of your OVHcloud services, including your [database](/pages/web/hosting/sql_change_password) and access to your [FTP storage](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_change_password).

> [!warning]
>
> Before changing the password for your website’s database in your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), update your website’s configuration file so that it connects to the database with the new password.
>
> Otherwise, changing your database password will result in a loss of access to your website or your services/customers that use it.
>
> If in doubt about the changes to be made, contact [OVHcloud partners](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/).
>

### Step 3: Intervene on your web hosting plan

First, write down the date on which the email from OVHcloud was sent, indicating that you want to deactivate your Web Hosting plan, and the folder or folders containing the examples of illegitimate files.

> [!primary]
>
> Our security robots can apply two levels of deactivation to your web hosting plan: 
>
> - disable it by applying a **CHMOD 700** to the FTP root of your web hosting plan
> - disable it by applying a **CHMOD 000** to the FTP root of your web hosting plan.
>
> If you wish to disable via FTP access restriction by ‘**CHMOD 000**’, please contact our [support teams](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/support-levels/) to check the status of your issue before following the steps in this guide. 
>
> Depending on your situation, these will apply a lower restriction by transforming the **CHMOD 000** into the **CHMOD 700** in order for you to be able to use your web hosting plan’s FTP space.
>

#### Case no. 1: Your Web Hosting plan has been disabled for less than two weeks

If your hosting plan was closed less than two weeks ago and only contains one website, restore your FTP storage space. If it contains multiple websites, only restore the folder or folders containing the illegitimate files.

To restore all or part of your FTP storage space, see [our guide](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_save_and_backup) on this topic.

> [!warning]
>
> Restoring your FTP storage space alone is not enough to correct potential security vulnerabilities previously present on your website.
> To identify these security vulnerabilities, analyse the [`web logs`](/pages/web/hosting/logs_and_statistics) of your web hosting plan, or contact a [specialised provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/) to perform a security audit on your websites.
>

#### Case no. 2: Your Web Hosting plan has been disabled for more than two weeks

If your hosting plan was closed more than two weeks ago, please contact a [specialist provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/) to perform a security audit on your websites.

> If you would like more details on the previous [steps 2 and 3](#step-2), please refer to our tutorial on [what to do if your website is hacked](/pages/web/hosting/cms_what_to_do_if_your_site_is_hacked).
>

### Step 4: Reactivate your Web Hosting plan <a name="reactivate-web-hosting"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> We recommend that you carry out a security audit **before** reopening your Web Hosting plan. Any malicious operation performed from your Web Hosting plan may result in your being held legally responsible.
>

#### Reactivating your hosting with FileZilla

> [!primary]
>
> If you want to install the **FileZilla** software to manipulate your website files, follow the instructions in this [guide](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_filezilla_user_guide).
>

Open the FileZilla application, then [log in to your FTP storage space](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_connectionn). Click on `Server`{.action} in the menu bar then on `Enter custom command`{.action} (the button may be differently labelled, depending on which version of FileZilla you are using):

![command_filezilla1](images/command_filezilla1.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, enter and validate the command below:

```
SITE CHMOD 705 /
```

![command_filezilla2](images/command_filezilla2.png){.thumbnail}

The response "**200 Permissions changed on /**" confirms that the change was successful. To check, try accessing your site again.

> [warning]
>
> You may need to wait a few minutes (maximum 20 minutes) for the change to be visible on your web browser.
>
> Depending on your website, you may also need to clear your browser’s cache.
>

If the above command does not work, you can try this other command:

```
SITE CHMOD 705.
```

#### Reactivating your hosting via your web browser with the FTP Explorer ("net2ftp")

In the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, then open `Hosting plans`{.action} and switch to the `FTP-SSH`{.action} tab of the Web Hosting plan concerned.

Press the `FTP Explorer`{.action} button and log in to your [FTP storage](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_connection).

Click on the `Advanced`{.action} button and then click the `Go`{.action} button next to "Send arbitrary FTP commands to the FTP server".

![net2ftp](images/net2ftp.png){.thumbnail}

At the top of the page, enter the command below:

```
SITE CHMOD 705 /
```

then click on the green "check mark" button.

![result_command_on_net2ftp](images/result_command_on_net2ftp.png){.thumbnail}

The response "**200 Permissions changed on /**" confirms that the change was successful. To check, try accessing your site again.

> [warning]
>
> You may need to wait a few minutes (maximum 20 minutes) for the change to be visible on your web browser.
>
> Depending on your website, you may also need to clear your browser’s cache.

## Objective

You can use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates to encrypt any data exchanged on or from your website. This prevents a malicious person or robot from “listening” clearly to requests sent or sent with your website.

OVHcloud offers several types of SSL certificates on our [OVHcloud shared hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/web-hosting/) solutions. They are set out in our guide on [Managing an SSL certificate on a Web Hosting plan](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/hosting/les-certificats-ssl-sur-les-hebergements-web/). SSL certificates are essential for the security of your website.

There are three types of SSL certificates:

- Domain Validation (DV)
- Organisation validation (OV)
- Extended Validation (EV)

SSL encryption levels are the same between these three certificate types.

The main difference lies in the level of checks that will be carried out by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issues the SSL certificate and attests to its authenticity.

EV SSL certificates are those for which the verification and security levels are highest. Generally, the EV SSL certificate is used for very large websites or sensitive websites. This certificate will provide the highest level of identification available.

For OVHcloud web hosting plans, the certification authority delivering EV SSL certificates is [Sectigo](https://sectigostore.com){.external}.

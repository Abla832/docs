Beside [three contacts](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/), to register a domain name, you need to enter information on the owner. This guide will detail how to change owner details.

[primary!]
>This operation will not move your domain to another account within OVH.
>
>To do this you need to change [contacts](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/).

**Find out how to change a domain name owner.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web){.external}
- a domain name registered with OVHcloud
- access as the [admin contact](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/) for the domain name concerned
- permission from the current domain name owner to change owners

## Instructions

### Select the domain.
Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager) and select `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. In the `Domains`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel, select the generic top-level domain (gTLD) you would like to change the owner of.

> [!warning]
>
> Any changes to the owner’s first name, surname, organisation, legal status and email address will be
> considered as a change of owner.
> 

An information message will open. Click `Continue`{.action}.

Once you have confirmed your action, two emails will be sent to confirm or decline this change:

- one sent to the current owner’s email address
- one sent to the future owner’s email address

Once the two recipients confirm their agreement via email, the domain name owner change will become effective.



> [!primary]
>
> 
> A maximum period of 60 days is authorised for the two recipients to confirm their agreement.
> 
> If the change is declined by one of the two parties, the action is cancelled.
> 
> 



> [!warning]
>
> If the domain name owner is changed successfully, the domain name will be
> locked, and cannot be part of an outgoing transfer for a 60-day period.

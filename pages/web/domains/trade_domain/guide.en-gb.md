## Objective

In addition to [contact management](/pages/account/customer/managing_contacts), registering a domain name requires you to enter information on the domain name owner. In this context, the **owner** refers to a person, company, organisation or association that owns the rights to this domain name. **Change of ownership** refers to the transfer of ownership rights from one person or company to another. **Owner** information has legal value. This process is particularly mandatory if a company changes its name.

> [!primary]
>This operation will not move your domain name to another OVHcloud customer account.
>
>To do this you need to change the domain name's [contacts](/pages/account/customer/managing_contacts).
>
> If you need to make a change of owner and a change of contact for the same domain name, there is no preferential order. However, it is the administrator contact who is able to initiate these operations. These two changes are therefore made in the Control Panel of ​​the domain name administrator contact.

**Find out how to provide you with information on how to change the owner of a domain name.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)
- a domain name registered with OVHcloud and for which no operation (owner change, transfer, creation) is in progress. If an operation has recently been finalised on your domain name, you will need to wait at least 60 calendar days before performing a new operation.
- access as the [admin contact](/pages/account/customer/managing_contacts) for the domain name concerned
- permission from the current domain name owner to change owners


## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> The following instructions describe the most common way to change the owner of a domain name. They are valid for most top-level domains, commonly known as **T**op **L**evel **D**omain (**TLD**). 
**TLDs** denote the end of your domain name, such as *.com*, *.net*, *.fr*, etc.
>
> The specific rules of the **TLD** domain name process are only defined by the appropriate allocation authority, i.e. the **registry**. A registrar such as OVHcloud must comply with these rules, and has no influence on registration decisions.
>
> There are mainly two types of **TLD**: **ccTLDs** and **gTLDs**. **ccTLDs** are **TLDs** for a region or country (*.fr*, *.be*, *.uk*, *.de*, *.paris*, etc.). **gTLDs** corresponding to more generic **TLDs** (*.net*, *.com*, *.info*, *.org*, etc.).
>
> The exact procedure for changing the owner of a domain name may therefore vary, particularly for some **ccTLDs**, such as *.lu*, *.hk*, *.ro*, *.be*, *.lt*, *.dk*, *.at*, *.fi*, etc.) and for some special **TLDs** (*.am*, *.fm*, etc.). For some of them, a change of ownership is a paid operation. The change of owner can also be suspended for various reasons, for example for unpaid, abuse or blocking by the registry. 
>
> We recommend that you consult the following resources if in doubt:
>
> - the corresponding **TLD** registry website
> - the [list of TLDs available at OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/tld/)
> - the `Ongoing operations`{.action} section of the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) to check any pending status updates of the domain name

### Step 1: Select the domain

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) and select `Web Cloud`{.action}. In the `Domains`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel, select the generic top-level domain (gTLD) you would like to change the owner of.

### Step 2: Inititate the owner change procedure

In the `General information`{.action} tab, go to the **Plan** section in the bottom right corner. Click `...`{.action} next to the **contacts**, then click `Change domain name holder`{.action}.

> [!warning]
>
> Any changes to the owner’s first name, surname, organisation, legal status and email address are treated as a change of owner.
> 
> If you are only changing owner details other than mentioned above, continue with the section [Updating the owner information](#updateownerinformation) below.

A new browser tab will open with all eligible domains. Select a domain name on the list by using the checkbox to the left of it. This step can also be used to launch a bulk operation: it is possible to initiate a domain trade for multiple domain names at once, for example to change the owner of all .ovh domains. When you have made your choices, click `Continue`{.action}.

In the owner details form, make sure to enter valid information into all the required fields. Avoid spelling mistakes and using [non-ASCII printable characters](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it212/documents/ascii-pr.htm) whenever possible. Please note that any inaccurate or false information may cause a technical error and therefore a delay of the entire trading process. 

Once you have confirmed your trade request, two emails will be sent to confirm or decline this change:

- one sent to the current owner’s email address
- one sent to the future owner’s email address

If the email address is not changed as part of the domain trade, one recipient will receive both emails but each of them needs to be confirmed regardless.
<br>Once the two recipients confirm the agreement via email, the domain name owner change will become effective.

> [!primary]
>
> The procedure can be validated by both parties during a period of 14 days.
> 
> If the change is declined by one of the two parties, the action will be cancelled.

> [!warning]
>
> If the domain name owner has been successfully changed, the domain name will be blocked from being [transferred to another registrar](../outgoing-transfer-of-generic-or-geographical-domain-name/) for a period of 60 days. 

### Updating the owner information <a name="updateownerinformation"></a>

If you need to update some secondary information such as phone number, address etc., you do not have to start a trade procedure. It can be edited directly in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB).

In the **Plan** section of the `General information`{.action} tab, click on `...`{.action} next to the **contacts**, then click `Refresh owner information`{.action}.

With this operation you do not need to confirm changes by email.

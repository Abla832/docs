## Objective

Beside [three contacts](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/), to register a domain name, you need to enter information on the owner. Owner of the domain is legal owner in the domain registry. This guide will detail how to change owner details.


[primary!]
>This operation will not move your domain to another account within OVHcloud.
>
>To do this you need to change [contacts](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/).

**Find out how to change a domain name owner.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web){.external}
- a domain name registered with OVHcloud
- access as the [admin contact](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/managing-contacts/) for the domain name concerned
- permission from the current domain name owner to change owners


## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> The following instructions describe the most common way to change domain name owner, valid for most Top Level Domains (TLD). However, the specific rules for processes regarding TLDs are solely defined by the appropriate allocation authority i.e. the **registry**. Registrars such as OVHcloud must adhere to these rules and have no influence over registry decisions.
>
> The exact procedure for domain trade may therefore vary, especially in case of some country-code TLDs (ccTLD, such as .lu, .hk, .ro, .be, .lt, .dk, .at, .fi, etc.) and a few special purpose TLDs (.am, .fm, etc.). For some of them trade is considered as paid operation. Trade might also be prohibited for various reasons, e.g. outstanding payment, abuse case or registry lock. 
>
> We recommend to consult the following resources in case of any doubt:
>
> - the website of the respective TLD registry
> - the [list of TLDs available at OVHcloud](https://www.ovh.co.uk/domains/prices/)
> - your new registrar's website and management interface, especially for questions about a pending transfer process
> - check if there is any ongoing operation for the domain in [Ongoing operations](https://www.ovh.com/manager/web/#/configuration/domains_operations)
>

### Select the domain.
Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager) and select `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. In the `Domains`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel, select the generic top-level domain (gTLD) you would like to change the owner of.

> [!warning]
>
> Any changes to the owner’s first name, surname, organisation, legal status and email address will be
> considered as a change of owner.
> 
> If you want to change other details for the owner you can use option `Refresh owner information`{.action} 
> Continue to [Refresh owner information](./#refresh-owner-information).

New tab in your browser will open with all available domains. Choose domain on the list, by marking it with checkbox and click `Continue`{.action}. It is possible to choose few domains with the same extension.

Once you have confirmed your action, two emails will be sent to confirm or decline this change:

- one sent to the current owner’s email address
- one sent to the future owner’s email address

If you are not changing email address - one recipient will receive two emails, both needs to be confirmed.
Once the two recipients confirm their agreement via email, the domain name owner change will become effective.



> [!primary]
>
> 
> A maximum period of 60 days is authorised for the two recipients to confirm their agreement.
> 
> If the change is declined by one of the two parties, the action is cancelled.
> 
> 



> [!warning]
>
> If the domain name owner is changed successfully, the domain name will be
> locked, and cannot be part of an outgoing transfer for a 60-day period.
> 

### Refresh owner information.

If you want to update some information like phone number, address etc. You do not need to start trade procedure, it can be done by `Refresh owner information`{.action}. With this operation you do not need to confirm changes by email.
